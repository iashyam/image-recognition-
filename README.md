# Vision Models

I have veen experimenting with Vision Models for quite a while now. I am trying to implement them from scartch to learn more about the neural netowrk architecture. I am also doing this to create a full end to end project, complete with automatic testing and deployment. I have done these models now

- MobileNet V2: Paper [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381)

TODO:

    - [ ] Containerize the model with Docker. 
    - [ ] Put automated testing with github actions. 
    - [ ] Deploy the model to server.
